BUGS
- libgit2 git.open() windows problem
- libgit2 git.config_find_*() linux problem
- giflib crashes with too-small strings
- expat_test takes too long
- libpng_test fails -- save not implemented
- svg_parser_demo doesn't work anymore (CairoSGPanel?)
- disposing objc classes with subclasses crashes

HOT TODO

- port luapower-git to multigit
	- change download page:
		- make buttons for windows, linux and osx (different deps!)

- unit testing day
 	- replace 'unit' with a proper unit testing library
		- busted
		- gambiarra
		- luaunit
		- shake even?
	- not testing anything (but fast and don't crash):
		bitmap_test
		freetype_test
		fribidi_test
		harfbuzz_test
		lexer_test

- forum day
	- development journal
	- luapower roadmap
	- who are you and what's your plan for world domination?
	- what modules would you like to see in luapower? poll?
	- horror stories
	- flame wars (find fire icon)

- describe how each aspect of a package manager is handled by different components:
	- github: author, contact
	- mgit: change management, transport
	- luapower: dependencies, platforms, description, C package info,
	- standard: docs, binaries, build tools, build scripts, unit tests, demos,

- API cleanup day
	- unprotect(pcall()) all I/O-bearing functions (glue.writefile, jpeg/png/gif load/save)

- documentation cleanup day
	- use of headings
	- move screenshots to media/web/* and route media/web to /media?

- website cleanup / bugs / design day
	- lights css select chrome bug
	- link styling remove colors and try this idea: http://daringfireball.net/
	- homepage
		- sorting of platform icons
	- package info page
		- missing information...
		- add links for built-in modules
		- don't make links for the rest of the built-in modules
		- which platform to go to for platform-dependent Lua modules? (package luajit)
	- doc page
		- "last updated ..." -> make it a link to the update log on that file!
	- change faq Q for luadist (get features from zerobrane blog)
	- discuss button
	- issues button
	- left sidebar
		- other modules in category
		- other categories
	- test website on firefox
	- test website on IE
	- generalize icon switches that show/hide stuff
		- fade animation
		- persist state
		- use local storage instead of cookies
	- the problem of blocking actions
		- git pull sucks the most
		- upgrade to a process queue system?
		- use shm/clear cache stack?

- anouncement day
	- put more pure-Lua libs on the lua wiki
	- put more Lua+ffi libs on the luajit wiki
	- ann the new version / changelog



LOW-PRIORITY
==============================================================================
- website
	- homepage stars: white and gray (7 days, 30 days)
	- news section with latest git commits?
		- user column on news (must be github user - clickable)
	- code browser
		- navigation on require"<module>"
		- parse definitions and make a in-memory database
		- navigate to symbols from other modules
		- editable online
		- literate-style view
	- comment system on all pages
		- source code annotation and comments
			- how to keep annotations in sync with changes in the code?
	- get-involved / license section:
		- put license tag in pkg.md
		- default license in absence of a license tag is public domain
		- put license files in csrc/pkg
	- get-involved / versioning section:
		- all packages in a collection should work together on their latest version
			- each package has to keep up with the others
				- if you break a package, _you_ have to upgrade all its dependants
		- conventions:
			- tag everything with just major version
			- increment the tag whenever existing behavior of any kind is changed
			- dependants will break automatically
	- do some research on package managers and their docs
		- read https://docs.npmjs.com/
		- read http://guides.rubygems.org/
	- homepage download buttons
		- make daily lock files (compare to the last lock file/ignore if identical)
		- make tag lockfiles (same algorithm)
		- make zip bundles based on just-made lockfile
		- make drop-down buttons which select old releases
- luapower
	- dev-dependencies <- dependencies required by tests, demos, and other scripts only
		- we can use the require parser for these to avoid having to run them
			- so these will not be per-platform dependencies (good enough)
	- infer license:
		- license/author tag in pkg.md
		- look for csrc/pkg/*LICENSE*
	- fix tests => run tests => record results and errors in luapower_db
	- rockspec generator
		- how to register origins of dependencies
		- Lua/C module paths must be for the right platform
	- infer binary dependencies
		- on windows: how?
		- on linux: how?
		- on osx: how?
	- parse luadoc headers from source
		- license/author fields
- bundle
	- busybox style exe/symlinking?
- multigit
	- allow =ver in .origin file
	- mgit path/to/mgit/root/<repo> ... <- check for slashes, and try to cd to that dir first
	- mgit install [path: default /usr/local/bin/mgit | C:/some-system-path]
	- mgit fork-replace pkg?
