BUGS
- libgit2 git.open() windows problem
- libgit2 git.config_find_*() linux problem
- giflib crashes with too-small strings
- expat_test takes too long
- libpng_test fails -- save not implemented
- svg_parser_demo doesn't work anymore (CairoSGPanel?)
- disposing objc classes with subclasses crashes

HOT TODO

- multigit
	- mgit pkg1,pkg2,... cmd ...
	- mgit fork-replace pkg?

- port luapower-git to multigit
	- remove {{#meta_package}} nonsense
	- change download page:
		- make buttons for windows, linux and osx (different deps!)
	- change faq Q for luadist (get features from zerobrane blog)

- package management documentation consolidation
	- read https://docs.npmjs.com/
	- read http://guides.rubygems.org/

- explanations
 	- versioning using only major version
 		- the only honest choice: the tags will show exactly how unstable an api really is
 		- explain how just adding an extra arg to a function breaks compat.
 	- explain M-N-hash versioning: M = API version, N = dev advancement

- increase transparency
	- version all packages
	- bump versions when APIs change
	- start committing with messages again so we can put back the news section

- download buttons
	- multiple release checkouts to different directories - is it possible?
		- make zip bundles based on release checkouts
	- version them with full date!
	- make the bundle script automatically delete old versions
	- make the homepage choose latest version based on files' mtime
	- keep old versions around (80M * 6 = 500M / day -- how many days can we keep?)
	- make daily lock files

- luapower day
	- document default license (public domain)
	- add license tag to pkg.md ?
	- parse license from pkg.lua header ?
	- fix tests => run tests => record results and errors in luapower_db

- unit testing day
	- dev-dependencies <- dependencies required by tests, demos, and other scripts only
 	- replace 'unit' with a proper unit testing library
		- busted
		- gambiarra
		- luaunit
		- shake even?
	- not testing anything (but fast and don't crash):
		bitmap_test
		freetype_test
		fribidi_test
		harfbuzz_test
		lexer_test

- forum day
	- development journal
	- luapower roadmap
	- faq entry: roadmap

	- hate mail
	- who are you and what's your plan for world domination?
	- what modules would you like to see in luapower? poll?
	- horror stories

- versioned dependencies brainstorm
	- note: need a way to specify version ranges of _indirect_ dependencies too!
	- objective:
		- all packages in a collection should work together on their latest version
			- so each package has to keep up with the others
				- if you break a package, you have to upgrade all its dependants
	- how to solve the problem without having to declare dependency ranges?
	- how useful is it in practice, even with the best of intentions? (not much)
	- simpler conventions:
		- tag everything with just major version
		- increment the tag whenever existing behavior of any kind is changed
		- dependants will break automatically
	- other ideas:
		- assume masters are always in sink at close times?
		- allow dependants to add tags to their dependencies?

- describe how each aspect of a package manager is handled by different components:
	- github: author, contact
	- mg: versioning, transport
	- luapower: dependencies, platforms, description, C package info,
	- standard: docs, binaries, build tools, build scripts, unit tests, demos,

- API cleanup day
	- unprotect(pcall()) all I/O-bearing functions (glue.writefile, jpeg/png/gif load/save)

- documentation cleanup day
	- use of headings
	- move screenshots to media/web/* and route media/web to /media?

- website cleanup / bugs / design day
	- homepage
		- sorting of platform icons
	- package info page
		- missing information...
		- add links for built-in modules
		- don't make links for the rest of the built-in modules
		- which platform to go to for platform-dependent Lua modules? (package luajit)
	- doc page
		- "last updated ..." -> make it a link to the update log on that file!
	- discuss button
	- issues button
	- left sidebar
		- other modules in category
		- other categories
	- test website on firefox
	- test website on IE
	- generalize icon switches that show/hide stuff
		- fade animation
		- persist state
		- use local storage instead of cookies
	- the problem of blocking actions
		- git pull sucks the most
		- upgrade to a process queue system?
		- use shm/clear cache stack?

- anouncement day
	- put more pure-Lua libs on the lua wiki
	- put more Lua+ffi libs on the luajit wiki
	- ann the new version / changelog
